### [H-01] On-Chain Data Visibility Compromises Contract Confidentiality

**Description:** All data stored on the blockchain is publicly visible, which inherently precludes it from being confidential. The variable `PasswordStore::s_password`, intended as private, is expected to be accessed solely via the `PasswordStore::getPassword` function.

**Impact:** The visibility of on-chain data allows anyone to read the supposedly private passwords, thereby compromising the contract's confidentiality.

**Proof of Concept:**
1. Initiate a local blockchain using:
    ```bash
    anvil
    ```
2. Deploy the contract to the local chain with:
    ```bash
    make deploy
    ```
3. Apply the storage inspection tool (`cast storage`) to the address of the deployed contract:
    ```bash
    cast storage $CONTRACT_ADDRESS 1 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
    ```
4. Decode the hex storage output to a string with `cast parse-bytes32-string`:
    ```bash
    cast parse-bytes32-string $OUTPUT_OF_THE_LAST_COMMAND
    ```

**Recommended Mitigation:** A re-evaluation of the entire architecture is necessary. A potential solution could be to store an encrypted version of the password off-chain and retain only the encrypted form on-chain.

### [S-02] Lack of Access Control in `PasswordStore::setPassword` Function

**Description:** The `PasswordStore::setPassword` function is currently unprotected, lacking checks on `msg.sender`, thereby permitting any user to exploit the function and alter the password. Project documentation stipulates that only the original user who stored the password should be able to invoke this password modification feature.

```solidity
function setPassword(string memory newPassword) external {
    // @audit ACCESS CONTROL MISSING
    s_password = newPassword;
    emit SetNetPassword();
}
```

**Impact:** This vulnerability enables any user to change the contract-stored password, undermining the project's core principle.

**Proof of Concept:**
Enhance the test suite by adding:
```solidity
function test_anyone_can_set_password(address randomAddress) public {
    vm.assume(randomAddress != owner);
    vm.prank(randomAddress);
    string memory expectedPassword = "myNewPassword";
    passwordStore.setPassword(expectedPassword);
    
    vm.prank(owner);
    string memory actualPassword = passwordStore.getPassword();
    assertEq(expectedPassword, actualPassword);
}
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** 
Implement access control within `PasswordStore::setPassword` as follows:

```solidity
require(msg.sender == owner);
```

### [I-03] Redundant NatSpec `@param` in `PasswordStore::getPassword`

**Description:** The NatSpec comments for `PasswordStore::getPassword` erroneously include a `@param` tag, which is unnecessary since the function does not accept any arguments.

**Impact:** Incorrect documentation may lead to confusion among users or developers interfacing with this contract.

```solidity
/**
 * @notice This function allows only the owner to retrieve the password.
 * @info There are no input parameters for this function.
 * @param newPassword The new password to set. // INCORRECT
 */
function getPassword() external view returns (string memory) {
    if (msg.sender != s_owner) {
        revert PasswordStore__NotOwner();
    }
    return s_password;
}
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Remove the irrelevant NatSpec `@param` line.

```diff
- * @param newPassword The new password to set.
```
